There I was, promising myself I was only going to play one more game of rocket league. The video game where soccer meets rocket powered cars. I tell my friends to hold on a minute, while I run to the freezer and serve up another bowl of ice cream. I got too the freezer and just grabbed the whole carton and ran back to my computer. I moved aside the empty chip bags and crumpled up candy wrappers and got back to work. I was living the good life.

Fast forward 2 months. I just finished another 5 hour gaming binge. I promised myself I'd only play 1 hour but games these days are engineered to commandeer our brains and pump us with dopamine hits over and over. I knew it was time. Something had to change. I was reluctant, I had tried everything to stop gaming and to stop eating junk food but nothing work and failure made it easier to turn back to gaming.
