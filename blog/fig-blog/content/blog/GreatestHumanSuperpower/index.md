Hang with me though these next few paragraphs.

Our house is terrible. I can't believe we have to pay so much for our utility bill and it is still freezing! The water heater only lasts MAYBE 20 mins on the cold days. Things keep breaking and it costs so much to fix. Our garage is too small and if it were only a little bit bigger I could do so much more. We can barely fit two cars inside.

We are bogged down with debt. We somehow keep getting medical bills that we can't pay. If only I could make more money, none of this would really matter.

My job is tough and I don't feel very appreciated. People at work just don't understand how to do their job and it makes it hard for everyone else.
