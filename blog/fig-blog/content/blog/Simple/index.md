## We've all been there

We get stuck.

The harder you try the more exhausting it gets. You know you are going down a rabbit hole but pride pushes you forward. On and onward off of the never-ending code cliff.

You think if you can just get this small piece working.

Before you know it, you have changed a bunch of files and have broken things that you didn't even know existed.

Stop doing this to yourself.

## Take a break

![Walk](./walk.jpg)

Get up and walk somewhere.

Anywhere.

Get a drink.

Go outside and walk somewhere new.

Clear your mind and let it wander.

As you allow yourself to escape and unravel you may surprise yourself.

## An idea will come

Maybe two.

Then comes the...

moment.

You naturally allow your brain to step back and see the bigger picture. You realize that 18 steps ago you could have changed one small thing and ü§Ø.

## You win.

Do not ignore the power of stepping away from an intensive task to regain perspective and ask yourself if there is a better way to overcome.
