> CJ left us with this mess and it's going to be forever before we get to a working point again. We are not going to hit the deadline because I'm going to be tied up in this for who knows how long.

> That's not possible. Frank and Tony don't listen to me and I don't have time to do it myself. They were messing around the last two weeks and now we are behind schedule.

> We don't have the process set up. I'm not taking any more work items until they clearly say what needs to be done. I'm tired of everyone changing their mind. Until we have a process I'm going to ignore these items.

We've all known people like this.

- Quick to blame others during hard times
- Letting everyone know it's out of their control
- Refusing to work until things are formatted perfectly

Let's try again.

> I understand that CJ left us with a few challenges but I will take care of it. If we get everyone working together we can meet the deadline. I'll reach out to Jeremy and we will take care of the logistics.

> I understand we are behind schedule and it's my fault. I've allowed things to get out of hand but I've talked with everyone and we are on the same page and will be caught up by the end of next week.

> I've noticed that some of these tickets are hard to understand. I've done some research and have found an easy process to better communicate what needs to be done. By implementing this we will save X amount of time per ticket and save X amount of money. What do you say?

Take 100% ownership of everything in your life.

- Own what is happening even when it's not directly your fault
- Spend mental energy on solving the problem instead of ways to skirt the blame.
- Become problem solvers and not problem creators or problem amplifiers.

When we learn to take ownership of everything we will launch ourselves forward in all areas of our lives.
